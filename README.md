# Vue A11y Examples

## Overview

Some examples using [`vue-a11y-utils@0.6.0+`](https://jinjiang.github.io/vue-a11y-utils/).

The purpose I wrote this repo is to:

* for myself, make sure `vue-a11y-utils` designed well (so this repo would be changed anytime if I update `vue-a11y-utils` in the future e.g. re-designing the API or adding some new features)
* for `vue-a11y-utils` users, provide use cases and code samples

_All the examples are inspired from [W3C WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices](https://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/)._
